- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, and/or software is functional and secure by checking to see if code successful runs via the JUnit test. Additionally, by following the secure coding principles such as input validation (validate and sanitize all data using an "allow" list to prevent attacks like SQL injection) and strict access control (I can make sure that each user has access to the right things).

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To incorporate and interpret user needs, I collect data based on users via surverys, analytics, and interviews. After collecting the data, I then look to incorporate them in my software to apply the needs that my users want.

- How do I approach designing software?

Depending on the type of software I'm designing, I look what the software's main goal is, and implement features that help it achieve it. Afterwards, I look at the software's functional and non-functional goals. After narrowing down the goals, I plan out the project and design the software's structure (how different components will interact with each other.), as well as design the software's UI and UX. Once I complete both of these things, I begin working on the software.
